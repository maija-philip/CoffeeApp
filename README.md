# CoffeeApp

For ISTE 252: Foundations of Mobile Design
Taken in my second semester of Sophomore Year

Project Assignment:
Create a minimum of three page coffee app where you can add/delete items to 
your cart as well as customize them as you are ordering the coffee. Display
the total cost of your cart.

My Thoughts:
I really enjoyed this project, it seemed way easier than it actually was. I
defenitely struggled with adding the modifications to the cart and deleting
the right item from the cart. I used fetch() to get the menu from a JSON file
and local storage to store the cart data. The design is based on a material
design we designed in groups and my team member Blanka designed the really 
amazing icons I got to use in this project.
